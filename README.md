This is a port of the Abot project to .NET Core. 

 I do not have time to work on this project. I'm looking for someone who can lead the porting efforts including documentation, setting up the build, nuget package creation, and issue management. I will give that person access as a contributor (and possible transfer of ownership) after a few pull requests demonstrate they are committed to making a great product.
